# ScoreStream Pro v0.2.0-beta — Release Notes

**Released:** 2026-02-19  
**Track:** Beta  
**Previous version:** v0.1.0-beta

---

## 🚀 What's New in This Release

### Channel Profile Assignment

ScoreStream channels can now be automatically assigned to specific Dispatcharr
**Channel Profiles** — the feature in Dispatcharr that controls which channels
each user or M3U playlist sees.

Three modes are available in `config/config.json`:

- **`all`** (default) — channels are added to every Channel Profile automatically.
  This preserves backward-compatible behavior from v0.1.0.
- **`none`** — channels are created in Dispatcharr but not assigned to any profile.
  Useful if you want to control profile membership manually in the Dispatcharr UI.
- **`specific`** — list exact profile IDs; ScoreStream only assigns to those profiles.

The API logs all available profile IDs at startup so you can always find the right numbers.

### Flexible Channel Numbering

Channel numbers are now fully user-configurable via `config/config.json`.

**Auto mode** (default): channels are numbered sequentially starting from
a configurable base number (default: 900). The sequence automatically adjusts
when you disable channels — no gaps.

**Manual mode**: assign any number you want to each channel independently.
Useful if you want ScoreStream channels to slot into specific positions in your
existing Dispatcharr lineup.

### Per-Channel Control

Every channel now supports three individual overrides in `config.json`:

- **`number`** — override the channel number in manual mode
- **`name`** — override the display name shown in Dispatcharr  
- **`enabled`** — set to `false` to completely skip a channel (it won't be
  created or updated in Dispatcharr)

### GitHub CI/CD — Automatic Docker Builds

Two GitHub Actions workflows are now included:

- **`beta.yml`** — builds and publishes `:beta` images automatically on every
  push to the `main` branch. Beta users always have the freshest build.
- **`release.yml`** — triggered when you publish a version tag. Builds
  multi-architecture images (amd64 + arm64), tags as `:latest` or `:beta`
  based on the version suffix, and creates a GitHub Release automatically.

### nginx Dockerfile

The web service now has its own Dockerfile, allowing the scoreboard HTML to be
baked into the image at build time. It can still be overridden at runtime with
a volume mount for development.

## ⬆️ Upgrading from v0.1.0-beta

### If you downloaded the zip manually

1. Back up your current setup:
   ```bash
   cp docker-compose.yml docker-compose.yml.bak
   ```

2. Download the new `docker-compose.yml`:
   ```bash
   curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OWNER/scorestream-pro/main/scorestream/docker-compose.yml
   ```

3. Create the config directory and file:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p config
   curl -o config/config.json https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OWNER/scorestream-pro/main/scorestream/config/config.json
   ```

4. Add to your `.env`:
   ```env
   GITHUB_OWNER=YOURUSERNAME
   SCORESTREAM_TAG=latest
   ```

5. Pull and restart:
   ```bash
   docker compose pull
   docker compose up -d
   ```

### No config changes needed

If you don't create a `config.json`, ScoreStream Pro falls back to the same
behavior as v0.1.0-beta (all channels, auto-numbering from 900, all profiles).
The upgrade is fully backward-compatible.

## ⚠️ Known Issues

- **Single renderer for all sport channels**: All 7 HLS channels currently share the
  same full-scoreboard video output. Per-sport isolated streams are planned for v0.3.0.
- **No web UI for config editing**: `config.json` must be edited manually. A browser-based
  configuration panel is planned for v0.3.0.
- **EPG not populated**: Dispatcharr channels are created without EPG data.
  XMLTV guide injection is on the roadmap.

---

## 🔜 Coming in v0.3.0-beta

- Web-based configuration panel (no more manual JSON editing)
- Off-season placeholder screens per sport ("Season starts in X days")
- Optional multi-renderer mode for true per-sport video isolation
- XMLTV/EPG injection — push program guide data alongside channels
